# VS Plugin Sandbox 

Tinkering with VS plugins.

## PascalSpace

Tries to make PascalCased and camelCased identifiers easier to read by highlighting or spacing bits of them.

Currently doesn't support configuration. Adjust the colours to your theme by setting the editor background colour in EnvironmentExpectations, and possibly tinkering with the MarkerAlpha. Highlight colours can be modified in the FormatDefinition classes.

Run the .vsix file from Explorer to install it.
